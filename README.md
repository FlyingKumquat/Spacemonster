Spacemonster v.1.0
======

Spacemonster is a JavaScript addon for [Rebuild the Universe](http://rebuildtheuniverse.com/).

This is not for cheating, it simply displays information you can find out on your own (if you wanted to do all the calculations) and cleans-up the UI a bit (if enabled). Everything in Spacemonster is an option that is disabled by default so you can pick and choose what you'd like see/change.

How to Use/Install
-----
Create a Bookmark and name it "Spacemonster" (or whatever you want to call it) then copy & paste the below code into the URL text box and click Save. Next, go [Rebuild the Universe](http://rebuildtheuniverse.com/) (wait for the page to fully load) and click the Bookmark you just created. If done correctly, you should see a new option on DripStat's navigation bar that reads "Spacemonster".
```JavaScript
javascript:(function(){
	$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/FlyingKumquat/Spacemonster/master/spacemonster.js')
}());
```

Alternatively, you can copy & paste the `$.getScript` function directly into the browser's console. Information on how to open your browser's console can be found [here](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers).
```JavaScript
$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/FlyingKumquat/Spacemonster/master/spacemonster.js')
```
